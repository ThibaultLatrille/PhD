\section*{Abstract}
Molecular evolution aims to characterize the mechanisms at work in the evolution of sequences.
These evolutionary mechanisms, which can be adaptive or neutral, simultaneously shape the coding sequences for proteins.
Understanding the respective roles of adaptation and the other evolutionary forces at work in the evolution of the proteome, characterizing the adaptation acting on individual proteins and identifying the variation of these forces are major challenges and bear many applications in biology.
