What determines the evolutionary rate of DNA sequences?

Can we disentangle the effect of mutation, selection and drift, or are they confounded?

Can we retrieve long-term fluctuation of population size? 

All inside a framework of point substitutions between population, but mechanistically grounded in population-genetics equations such as to be generalized to within population.
